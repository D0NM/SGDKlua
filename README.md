# SGDK lua Scripts 2026

I will add here some simple Lua scripts helping with SGDK our gamedev.
Hope theses scripts might be a help for you.

Do with then all you want, no need for any refs.

I use these scripts daily coding our [Zabu beat 'em up game for Sega Genesis / Megadrive](https://zabu.team/).

To run scripts right from VS Code I prefer Code Runner extension [formulahendry.code-runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner)
